Google Charts are query printers for Semantic MediaWiki applying the Google Charts API
documented at https://developers.google.com/chart/image/

Important notes:
* You must not forget that every time a user comes to a page embedding a Google chart,
Google gets a ping. Moreover your data is being sent to Google in order to render it.
!! The creator of Semantic Result Formats have not control over and cannot take any
responsibility in case of any misuse resulting from this !!
* As of April 20, 2012 the Google Charts API is deprecated and may be shut down
without further notice. Thus you are advised to not rely on these two formats.
* Do not forget also that these printers do not work offline, if you have a local wiki. 

Currently two query printers are available for bar and pie charts. For up-to-date
documentation, please refer to:
* https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Google_bar_format for the Google bar format
* https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Google_pie_format for the Google pie format

Semantic Result Formats provides these two legacy result printers for your convenience.
