Google Charts are query printers for Semantic MediaWiki applying the Google Charts API
documented at https://developers.google.com/chart/image/

Currently two query printers are available for bar and pie charts. For up-to-date
documentation, please refer to:
* https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Google_bar_format for the Google bar format
* https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Google_pie_format for the Google pie format

Note: As of April 20, 2012 the Google Charts API is deprecated and may be shut down
without further notice. Thus you are advised to not rely on these two formats.

Semantic Result Formats provides these two legacy result printers for your convenience.
