SRF YearCal
=============================

The YearCal SRF displays a calendar table covering one year. For each "line" in the result table it places
a two digit abbreviation in the cell of the corresponding date. If given a second argument (a second date),
it interprets this as a time span, beginning with the first and ending with a second date.

If the argument is not a date, or the time span is negative (end date before start date), nothing is
displayed in the calendar.


* INSTALLATION

The "yearcal"-Subdirectory must be copied into the .../extensions/SemanticResultFormats/formats Folder.
I understand that for SMW 1.9+ this is already sufficient, but have not tried it myself.

For SMW 1.8 two more edits of files in the SemanticResultFormats Directory are required:

a. SemanticResultFormats.php
----------------------------
   Find the line
	  $wgAutoloadClasses['SRFCalendar']  = $formatDir . 'calendar/SRF_Calendar.php';
   and add the following line right below it:
	  $wgAutoloadClasses['SRFYearCal']   = $formatDir . 'yearcal/SRF_YearCal.php';

   Also find the line
        'calendar' => 'SRFCalendar',
   and add the following line right below it:
        'yearcal' => 'SRFYearCal',

b. SemanticResultFormats.settings.php
-------------------------------------
   Find the line
 	'calendar',
   and add the following line right below it:
       'yearcal',


* USAGE

Set date properties on your SMW pages that can be searched. As YearCal is designed to render time spans
(e.g. a 2 week holiday) it is a good idea to use subobjects for this (records work, too, but are
depreceated). Subobjects have the additional advantage that if named with a two digit/letter code, this
code will be used for the calendar display instead of the automatically generated two digit code, which
sometimes will look odd or create unwanted duplicates.

Example:
Create a page called "YearCal-Test" and fill it with {{#subobject:XY|start=2014-08-02|end=2014-08-06}}.
Assuming that the properties "start" and "end" are not yet in other usage, the #ask query could look
like this:

{{#ask: [[start::+]] 
| ?start
| ?end
| format=yearcal
| default=No entries found
}}

This should display a calender showing "XY" from 2nd to 8th of August 2014. A mouseover on these entries
should display a tooltip "YearCal-Test".


* CUSTOMIZING

You may create a page called "SRF YearCal". Any date property set on this page will not render as a
"normal" date entry, but will rather result in the corresponding date value in the calendar to be 
drawn inverted (white text on gray background). This feature is intended to code "generic" dates such
as public holiday or the like.

If you do not like the 8 predefined background colors, or would like to add more, find the line 
beginning with "$colors = array..." in the SRF_YearCal.php file and adjust it to your liking.
